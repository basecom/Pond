                What is a pond?
            </UiAccordionTrigger>
            <UiAccordionContent>
                A pond is a small, shallow body of water, typically smaller than a lake, that can be either natural or
                artificial. It supports various aquatic plants, animals, and microorganisms, and is usually freshwater, though
                some ponds may contain brackish water.

                Ponds are home to many types of animals, including fish like goldfish and bass, amphibians like frogs and
                salamanders, aquatic insects like dragonflies and water striders, as well as birds such as ducks and herons. The
                specific animals depend on the pond's location and ecosystem.

                Why are ponds important for the environment?
            </UiAccordionTrigger>
            <UiAccordionContent>
                Ponds play a crucial role in the environment by providing habitats for various species, supporting biodiversity,
                and acting as natural water filters. They help with groundwater recharge, support plant life, and provide
                resources for animals. Additionally, ponds can regulate local climate conditions and contribute to carbon storage.
